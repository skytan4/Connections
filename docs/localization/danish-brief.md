## Agent Non-Negotiables

Copy these into every Danish translation or audit-agent prompt:

- Use informal **du** throughout; never use formal `De`, `Dem`, or `Deres` as user address.
- Keep Danish reserved, warm, and natural; do not import English emotional intensity or therapy phrasing.
- Avoid gender assumptions for unknown people; prefer neutral person references or restructure.
- Check compounds and idioms; plausible-looking Danish compounds can still sound translated.
- Do not drift into Norwegian or Swedish forms; keep standard Danish spelling and word choice.
- Preserve strict source fidelity for follow-ups; translate the exact attached follow-up.
- Keep sex/intimacy direct and adult, not crude or clinical.
- Preserve `…` sentence completions as fragments.
- Keep brand terms in English: Deeper Conversations, Life Story, Fall in Love, Share an Experience.
- Preserve all JSON IDs, metadata, order, and UI placeholders exactly.

## Register

- **Warm, natural, emotionally intelligent Danish.** Write as a thoughtful friend would speak.
- **Informal `du` throughout.** Never use `De` (formal capital-D) as a formal second-person address. Modern Danish always uses `du`.
- **Danish directness.** Danish is direct, warm, and understated — similar to Swedish. Avoid theatrical or melodramatic phrasing.
- **Preserve ellipses (`…`) in sentence-completion prompts.** If the English prompt ends with `…`, the Danish must too, and must remain an unfinished fragment.

## Gender Policy — Neutral-First (Hard Rule)

Danish has grammatical gender (common/neuter) but good neutral options.

**Hard rule:** Do not assume the user's or partner's gender.

| Banned form | Why | Use instead |
|---|---|---|
| `han` / `hun` | Gendered third-person pronouns | `de` (singular neutral), `personen`, omit |
| `ham` / `hende` | Gendered object pronouns | `dem`, `personen`, restructure |
| `hans` / `hendes` | Gendered possessives | `deres`, `personens`, restructure |
| `De` (formal capital) | Formal address | `du` |

**Note on `de`:** In modern Danish, `de`/`dem`/`deres` is increasingly used as a singular gender-neutral pronoun, similar to English "they/them." This is acceptable in this context.

**Preferred gender-neutral constructions:**

| Context | Preferred Danish |
|---|---|
| Referring to the partner | `din partner`, `den anden person`, `den anden` |
| Referring to both people | `I`, `jer to`, `jeres forhold`, `sammen` |
| Unknown-gender third person | `de` (singular neutral), `personen`, omit |
| Possessive for partner | `din partners`, `den andens` |

## Tone by Content Type

### Light
- Accessible, warm, easy-going. Everyday Danish register.

### Honest
- Sincere, clear, direct. Danish directness — not over-hedged, not blunt.

### Unfiltered
- Direct emotional truth. Danish understatement is an asset. Plain, direct questions carry weight without theatrics.

### Warm Up / Real Talk / Deep Dive
- Natural escalation in seriousness and depth.

### Sex / Intimacy
- Direct and adult. Not clinical, not crude. Danish has a comfortable adult register — use it.
- Completion prompts ending in `…` must remain fragments.

### Hardship / Grief / Regret
- Gentle, respectful, spacious. Danish emotional restraint — no added sentimentality.

### Family / Friends / Life Story
- Warm and natural. Life Story = dignified, unhurried.

---

## Sentence-Completion Prompts

**Hard rule:** Preserve the fragment shape. English `…` → Danish `…`, remain a fragment.

## Brand Terms — Keep in English

| Term | Policy |
|---|---|
| Deeper Conversations | English only |
| Life Story | English only |
| Fall in Love | English only |
| Share an Experience | English only |

---

## UI Label Guidance

- Danish strings are typically similar length to English.
- Preserve all format placeholders exactly: `%1$@`, `%2$@`, `%1$lld`, etc.
- All labels use `du`/`dig`/`dit`, never formal `De`/`Dem`.

---

## Danish-Specific Risks

### `De` Formal Register
Capital-D `De`/`Dem`/`Deres` is the very formal pronoun. It looks like the plural `de`/`dem`/`deres` but is capitalized. Flag any capital-D `De` used as formal address.

### `Han`/`Hun` Defaults
Most common agent error: defaulting to `han`/`hun` for partners. Check all partner references.

### Compound Words
Danish forms compound nouns written as one word: `kærlighedsforhold`, `hverdagsliv`.

### Softening
Danish emotional directness should be preserved. Watch for over-hedged translations of unfiltered prompts.
